An increasing number of crimes against women has planted seeds of fear in the minds of Indian people. 
These fears ultimately result in the imposition of deadlines and strict rules which every woman has to comply with, willingly or unwillingly. 
So, for the peace of mind for their friends and relatives we have created this app. 

iMERGENCY for Women is an app made to send the users current location messages.

This has an EMERGENCY and ON MY WAY button which you can press to send messages via WhatsApp and text message along with your current location.

We have added an additional feature as when in a panic mode you can say a word HELP to which emergency button will be 
activated and the messages will be sent to your loved ones through voice detection for immediate help. This website has a Safety confirmation feature.

On reaching the location safely the users can inform their near ones by pressing the Reached button.

Itâ€™s our responsibility to keep your data private and secure, so All the information you would provide will be stored on your local machine only.

The goal is to protect them from all the incorrect activities that a woman faces and help woman to move around, with confidence.

Note-This App is using trial-based API so there are certain limits for the messages that will be sent.
